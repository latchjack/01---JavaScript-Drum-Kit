This project is from the JavaScript30 tutorial series created by Wes Bos.

In this project I practiced event handling, DOM manipulation and intergrating audio using JavaScript. 

The drums sound plays when a key is touched by using the keyboards keycode. If the key is not assigned a sound it ends the function. However if the keycode is assigned a sound it will play the sound which was attached to the keycode. It also adds and removes the class of 'playing' to the key which changes the styling of the key so the user can see that their button press has been registered.
